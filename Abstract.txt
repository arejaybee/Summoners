Summoners
This game, Summoners, is a tactical game in which players control two summoners with the single goal of killing one another. Summoners can summon different creatures to serve as military units to fight the other summoner. At the start of each player’s turn they accumulate mana, which they can then use to pay the summoning cost for different units. The artists were tasked with creating models and animations for each individual unit. They used their talents to create many creative and good looking creatures for players to command. Programmers, who worked with Unity, were tasked with moving the different units on a gridded platform, having those units fight, and keeping the game from crashing. The game is two player game, much like chess. It will truly test the tactical superiority of each player. We will be presenting Summoners and the challenges we overcame in its development.
